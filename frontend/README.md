# Frontend - Board Games

This is the frontend portion of the **Board Games** project, built with React and Vite.

## Folder Structure

- `frontend/`: Root directory containing the React app.
- `frontend/src/`: Contains the source code, including components, routes, and assets.

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Frontend

To start the frontend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# React + Vite

The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:5173/`

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
